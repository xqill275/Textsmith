# Textsmith Roadmap

Welcome to the development roadmap for **Textsmith**, a lightweight, modular engine for building text-based adventure games in Python.

This roadmap outlines planned features and goals leading up to the **v1.0** release. Contributions, ideas, and feedback are always welcome!

- [ ] Add `EXIT` or `QUIT` command
- [ ] Optional: Add `HELP` command
- [ ] Update README with instructions for interactive play

## Version 0.3 â€“ Engine Extensibility
> Goal: Make it easier to build custom mechanics

- [ ] Add room event hooks (`on_enter`, `on_exit`)
- [ ] Allow custom actions on rooms or players
- [ ] Enable easier subclassing of core classes
- [ ] Define constants/enums for directions (e.g., `Direction.NORTH`)
- [ ] Refactor command handling for custom commands

---

---

## Version 0.6 â€“ Testing & Stability
> Goal: Make the engine stable and testable

- [ ] Unit tests for `Game`, `Room`, `Player`
- [ ] Tests for command parsing and movement
- [ ] Setup linter (e.g., `flake8`, `black`)
- [ ] Improve validation and error messages

---

## Version 0.7 â€“ Quality of Life Enhancements
> Goal: Improve developer and player experience

- [ ] Option for auto bi-directional room connections
- [ ] Handle bad input more gracefully
- [ ] Add optional room ID or UUID
- [ ] Support flexible direction input (`"north"`, `"n"`, `"NORTH"`)

---

##  Version 0.8 â€“ Packaging and Installability
>  Goal: Make it installable as a Python package

- [ ] Add `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Include `__init__.py` for module structure
- [ ] Create installable pip package
- [ ] Publish to PyPI (optional)
- [ ] Include a sample game in `/examples/`

---

##  Version 0.9 â€“ Documentation and Community
> Goal: Improve onboarding and contributions
