# TEXTSMITH

**Version 0.1**

This is a simple, modular, text-based game engine built in Python. It provides a framework for developers to create their own interactive text-based games, focusing on rooms, players, and basic commands like "LOOK" and "MOVE." It aims to offer a flexible foundation for building adventure games and other text-based experiences.

---

## Features

- **Player Class**: Represents the player in the game world. The player can move between rooms.
- **Room Class**: Defines rooms in the game world with connections in four cardinal directions (north, south, east, west). Each room has a name and description.
- **Game Class**: Handles game logic, such as processing player commands ("LOOK", "MOVE"), updating the player's location, and displaying room descriptions.

---

## Getting Started

To get started with the engine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-based-game-engine.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd text-based-game-engine
    ```

3. The engine doesn't require additional dependencies; Python's standard library is sufficient to run.

---

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick example to get you started with the engine:

### Example: Basic Game Setup

```python
from engine import game, player, room

# Create rooms
room1 = room.Room("Test Room1", "This is a test room where you spawn.")
room2 = room.Room("Test Room2", "This is the second room you can move to.")

# Link rooms together (north direction for this example)
room1.updateConnectionts(0, room2)

# Create a player
playerObject = player.Player("Test Player")

# Create a game object
gameObject = game.Game(playerObject)

# Update the player's current room
gameObject.updateRoom(room1)

# Player looks at their current room description
gameObject.readCommand("LOOK", None)

# Player moves north
gameObject.readCommand("MOVE", 0)

# Player looks at the new room description
gameObject.readCommand("LOOK", None)
```

### Available Commands

- **LOOK**: Shows the description of the current room.
- **MOVE**: Moves the player in the specified direction (0 - north, 1 - south, 2 - east, 3 - west).

```
engine/
â”œâ”€â”€ game.py          # Contains the Game class handling game logic and commands.
â”œâ”€â”€ player.py        # Contains the Player class that represents the player.
â”œâ”€â”€ room.py          # Contains the Room class that defines rooms and connections.
```
